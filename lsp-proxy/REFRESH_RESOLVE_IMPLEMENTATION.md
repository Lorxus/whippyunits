# Inlay Hint Refresh and Resolve Implementation

## Overview
We have successfully implemented comprehensive support for inlay hint refresh and resolve events in the whippyunits LSP proxy. This implementation handles both the message interception and the processing of resolve responses to pretty-print whippyunits types.

## Key Components Implemented

### 1. Refresh Event Handling
- **Detection**: Added `is_refresh_notification()` method to identify `workspace/inlayHint/refresh` notifications
- **Processing**: Refresh notifications are passed through unchanged (they're notifications, not requests)
- **Logging**: Refresh events are logged for debugging purposes

### 2. Resolve Request Handling
- **Detection**: Added `is_resolve_request()` method to identify `inlayHint/resolve` requests
- **Processing**: Resolve requests are passed through unchanged (we intercept the response)
- **Logging**: Resolve requests are logged for debugging purposes

### 3. Resolve Response Processing
- **Detection**: Enhanced `is_inlay_hint_response()` to handle both array and object results
- **Processing**: Resolve responses (single objects) are now properly processed by the inlay hint processor
- **Type Conversion**: Whippyunits types in resolve responses are converted to pretty format

### 4. Enhanced Inlay Hint Processor
- **Dual Support**: Modified `process_inlay_hint_response()` to handle both:
  - Arrays (typical for inlay hint requests)
  - Objects (typical for resolve responses)
- **New Method**: Added `process_single_hint_object()` to process single inlay hint objects

## Message Flow

### Refresh Flow
1. Client sends `workspace/inlayHint/refresh` notification
2. Proxy intercepts and logs the notification
3. Proxy passes through unchanged to rust-analyzer
4. rust-analyzer responds with refresh acknowledgment
5. Client re-requests inlay hints (triggering normal inlay hint processing)

### Resolve Flow
1. Client sends `inlayHint/resolve` request with inlay hint ID
2. Proxy intercepts and logs the request
3. Proxy passes through unchanged to rust-analyzer
4. rust-analyzer responds with detailed inlay hint information
5. Proxy intercepts the resolve response
6. Proxy processes the response to pretty-print whippyunits types
7. Proxy sends the processed response back to client

## Test Coverage

### `inlay_hint_refresh_test.rs`
- **Live Capture**: Captures real refresh events from rust-analyzer
- **Event Triggering**: Demonstrates how to trigger refresh events via document changes
- **Message Analysis**: Analyzes the structure and timing of refresh events

### `refresh_resolve_test.rs`
- **Message Type Detection**: Tests all message type detection methods
- **Refresh Notification Handling**: Tests refresh notification processing
- **Resolve Request Handling**: Tests resolve request processing
- **Resolve Response Handling**: Tests resolve response processing and type conversion

## Key Findings from Testing

### Refresh Events
- Refresh events are triggered by `didChange` notifications
- They have the structure: `{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":2,"method":"workspace/inlayHint/refresh"}`
- They are notifications (have an `id` but no `params`)
- The client should respond by re-requesting inlay hints

### Resolve Events
- Resolve requests have the structure: `{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":5,"method":"inlayHint/resolve","params":{...}}`
- Resolve responses have a single object as the result (not an array)
- The object contains detailed inlay hint information including `position`, `label`, `tooltip`, and `textEdits`

## Implementation Details

### Message Type Detection
```rust
// Refresh notifications
fn is_refresh_notification(&self, lsp_msg: &LspMessage) -> bool {
    if let Some(method) = &lsp_msg.method {
        method == "workspace/inlayHint/refresh"
    } else {
        false
    }
}

// Resolve requests
fn is_resolve_request(&self, lsp_msg: &LspMessage) -> bool {
    if let Some(method) = &lsp_msg.method {
        method == "inlayHint/resolve"
    } else {
        false
    }
}

// Inlay hint responses (enhanced for both arrays and objects)
fn is_inlay_hint_response(&self, lsp_msg: &LspMessage) -> bool {
    if let Some(result) = &lsp_msg.result {
        // Handle arrays (inlay hint requests)
        if result.is_array() {
            // Check for inlay hint structure in array items
        }
        // Handle objects (resolve responses)
        if result.is_object() {
            // Check for inlay hint structure in object
        }
    }
    false
}
```

### Enhanced Processor
```rust
pub fn process_inlay_hint_response(&self, message: &str) -> Result<String> {
    let mut json_value: Value = serde_json::from_str(message)?;
    
    if let Some(result) = json_value.get_mut("result") {
        // Handle arrays (inlay hint requests)
        if let Some(results_array) = result.as_array_mut() {
            for hint in results_array {
                self.process_single_hint(hint)?;
            }
        }
        // Handle objects (resolve responses)
        else if let Some(single_hint) = result.as_object_mut() {
            self.process_single_hint_object(single_hint)?;
        }
    }
    
    Ok(serde_json::to_string(&json_value)?)
}
```

## Benefits

1. **Complete Coverage**: Now handles all inlay hint related messages (requests, responses, refresh, resolve)
2. **Proper Type Conversion**: Resolve responses are properly converted to pretty format
3. **Robust Detection**: Handles both array and object result formats
4. **Comprehensive Testing**: Full test coverage for all message types
5. **Debugging Support**: Logging for all intercepted messages

## Usage

The implementation is now ready for production use. The LSP proxy will automatically:
- Intercept and log refresh notifications
- Intercept and log resolve requests
- Process resolve responses to pretty-print whippyunits types
- Maintain all existing functionality for regular inlay hint requests

No additional configuration is required - the proxy will handle all inlay hint related messages automatically.
